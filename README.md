# React-One
This project is based on webpack to provide a base structure to start developing with React. It's meant to follow a _Domain Driven Design_ but, can be improved and ideas will be very welcome. 

Thanks Pedro Soares for every discussion that we had back at Tekoa, working on Gambit.

## How to work with?

Main execution script:

- _**npm run start**_ 
build & start the server on http://localhost:3000
