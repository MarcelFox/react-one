# React-One
This project is based on webpack to provide a base structure to start developing with React. It's meant to follow a _Domain Driven Design_ but, can be improved and ideas will be very welcome. 

Thanks Pedro Soares for every discussion that we had back at Tekoa, working on Gambit.

## How to work with?

There are a few scripts available on project's _package.json_

- _**npm run dev**_ 
start the webpack dev server on http://localhost:8080

- _**npm run build**_ 
builds the project and stores it at the _dist_ directory

- _**npm run docker:dev**_ 
start the webpack dev server on http://localhost:8080 inside a docker container

- _**npm run build**_ 
builds the project inside a docker container and stores it at the _dist_ directory
